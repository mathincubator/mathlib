    The rational root theorem uses the leading coefficient and the constant term

    P is an integer factor of the constant term a0.

    Hamonic Mean:
    In mathematics, the harmonic mean is one of several kinds of average, and in particular, is one of the three Pythagorean means.

    Example: If we travel 10 km at 60 km/h, then another 10 km at 20 km/h, what is our average speed?

Primes:
Prime numbers are numbers that has 2 factors and can only be divisible by 1 and itself.
For example, 7 is a prime number because its factors are only 1 and itself.
27 is not a prime number because it's factors are 1, 3, 9, 27.
1 is also not a prime number because its only factor is 1.

Prime Factorization:
Prime Factorization is the process of decomposing a non-prime (composite) number until it becomes a prime number.
Example: 27: 27/3 = 9, 9/3 = 3. Prime factors are 3, 3, 3. It can also be written as 3^3.

Example Code:
